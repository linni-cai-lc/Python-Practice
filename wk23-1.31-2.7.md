```python
def main(arr):
   first = arr[0]
   delta = (arr[-1] - first) // len(arr)
   l = 0
   r = len(arr) - 1
   while l < r:
      m = (l + r) // 2
      if arr[m] == first + m * delta:
         l = m + 1
      else:
         r = m
   return first + delta * l
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(logN), space = O(1)
#### Intuition: the problem mentions that the removed element is not the first/last element in the array, then we can obtain the correct delta value from the last and first elements and current length (the real intervals + 1), utilize binary search to reduce time complexity

```python
def main(arr):
   delta = []
   for i in range(1, len(arr)):
      delta += [arr[i] - arr[i-1]]
   delta_set = set(delta)
   if len(delta_set) == 1:
      return arr[0]
   diff1 = delta_set.pop()
   diff2 = delta_set.pop()
   real_delta = diff1 if abs(diff1) < abs(diff2) else diff2
   prob_delta = diff2 is abs(diff2) < abs(diff1) else diff1
   return arr[delta.index(prob_delta)] + real_delta
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)

# [1018](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-prefix-divisible-by-5/)
```python
def main(A):
   cur = 0
   res = []
   for i in range(len(A)):
      cur += cur + A[i]
      res += [cur % 5 == 0]
   return res
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of integers in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1) exclude result space

# [1668](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-repeating-substring/)
```python
def main(sequence, word):
   cnt = 1
   cur = word
   while cur in sequence:
      cnt += 1
      cur += word
   return cnt - 1
```
#### Assumption: S = the length of sequence string, W = the length of word string, K = the occurrence of word string in sequence string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(KW), space = O(KW)

# [521](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)
```python
def main(a, b):
   if a == b:
      return -1
   return max(len(a), len(b))
```
#### Assumption: A = the length of string a, B = the length of string b
#### Complexity: runtime = O(min(A, B)), space = O(1)
#### Intuition: dominant time cost is on string comparison, provides min(A, B), for different lengths, comparison finished early on shorter string.

# [1662](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-string-arrays-are-equivalent/)
```python
def main(word1, word2):
   l = 0
   r = 0
   l_idx = 0
   r_idx = 0
   while l < len(word1) and r < len(word2):
      if word1[l][l_idx] != word2[r][r_idx]:
         return False
      l_idx += 1
      r_idx += 1
      if l_idx == len(word1[l]):
         l += 1
         l_idx = 0
      if r_idx == len(word2[r]):
         r += 1
         r_idx = 0
   return l == len(word1) and r == len(word2)
```
#### Assumption:
W1 = the number of words in word1 list, \
L1 = the length of a word in word1 list, \
W2 = the number of words in word2 list, \
L2 = the length of a word in word2 list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(W1L1+W2L2), space = O(1)
