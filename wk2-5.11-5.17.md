# Python-Practice
## Week 2 [5.11-5.17]
- [240](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii)
  - sorted 2D matrix search
  - row = height - 1, col = 0, starts at left bottom corner
  - cur < target: col++
  - cur > target: row--
  - cur = target: True
  - O(n + m) `AC`
- [34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)
  - array binary search
  - extreme find via binary search
  - O(logN) `AC`
- [875](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
  - array binary search
  - use math.ceil to calculate the number of hours to eat -> compare sum with target
  - reduce eat time from large to small
  - O(NlogM) `AC`

### Divide and Conquer
- [215](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
  - max heap of size k for a list of size n
  - can utilize python heapq.nlargest
  - build a priority queue and build up heap, keep the size <= k
  - O(nlogk) `AC`
- [23](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
  - go through both lists
  - connect with rest list after while loop
  - O(n + m) `AC`
- [15](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
  - two pointer search through the list
  - nested for loop and used set to reduce duplicates
  - O(n^2) `AC`
- [21](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
  - recursive merge
  - O(N+M) `AC`
- [53](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
  - greedy
  - sumi = max(nums[i], sumi+nums[i])
  - O(n) `AC`
- [241](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/)
  - recursively call
  - outer for loop through the given string
  - inner nested loop through LS, RS
  - LS = func(nums[:i]), RS = func(nums[i+1:])
  - O(n^2)
- [169](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
  - brute force
    - can utilize collections.Counter(nums).most_common()[0][0]
    - store in map, outer loop use set(nums), inner loop use original list
    - O(n)
  - divide and conquer
    - left and right conquer
    - O(nlgn)
- [167](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
  - binary search
  - L = 0, R = len(nums) - 1
  - sum = nums[L] + nums[R]
  - sum < target: L++
  - sum > target: R--
  - at most visit each element once, loop through the list
  - O(N)
