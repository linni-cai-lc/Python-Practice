      start, end = intervals[i]

```
#### Assumption: N = the number of intervals
#### Complexity: runtime = O(NlogN), space = O(1)

# [253](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
def main(intervals):
   intervals.sort(key=lambda x:x[0])
   start, end = intervals.pop(0)
   room = [(end, start)]
   for start, end in intervals:

      else:
         heappush(room, (end, start))
      heappush(room, (pre_end, pre_start))
   return len(room)
```
#### Notes: Utilize max heap, to prioritize the end time
#### Assumption: N = the number of intervals
#### Complexity: runtime = O(NlogN), space = O(N)

# [218](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapify
def getSkyline(buildings):
   res = []
   build = []
   for l,r,h in buildings:
      build += [[l, -h], [r, h]]
   build.sort()
   heap = [0]
   preH = 0
   for x, y in build:
      if y < 0:
         heappush(heap, y)
      else:
         heap.remove(-y)
         heapify(heap)
      curH = -heap[0]
      if curH != preH:
         res += [[x, curH]]
         preH = curH
   return res
```
#### Note: Utilize Heap, but python built-in heap is min heap, we need to reverse the sign of the height, furthermore, heapify caused runtime higher, java's priority queue can prevent this runtime issue, reduce to O(NlogN)
#### Assumption: N = the number of buildings
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N^2*logN), space = O(N)
```python
from collections import Counter
def getSkyline(buildings):
   res = []
   build = []
   for l,r,h in buildings:
      build += [[l, -h], [r, h]]
   build.sort()
   heap = Counter()
   heap[0] = 1
   preH = 0
   for x, y in build:
      if y < 0:
         heap[-y] += 1
      else:
         heap[y] -= 1
         if heap[y] == 0:
            del heap[y]
      curH = max(heap)
      if curH != preH:
         res += [[x, curH]]
         preH = curH
   return res
```
#### Note: Utilize Counter, which is a dictionary to store count int for each height, reduce the runtime, but with larger space, however, the space upper bound is still O(N)
#### Assumption: N = the number of buildings
#### Complexity: runtime = O(NlogN), space = O(N)

# [57](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)
```python
def main(intervals, newInterval):
   new_start, new_end = newInterval
   L = 0
   R = len(intervals)-1
   while L <= R:
      M = (L + R) // 2
      if intervals[M][0] < new_start:
         L = M - 1
      else:
         R = M + 1
   intervals.insert(l, newInterval)
   res = [intervals.pop(0)]
   for i in range(len(intervals)):
      start, end = intervals[i]
      pre_start, pre_end = res[-1]
      if pre_start <= start <= pre_end:
         res[-1][0] = min(start, pre_start)
         res[-1][1] = max(end, pre_end)
      else:
         res += [[start, end]]
   return res
```
#### Note: Use binary search to find insertion location for new interval, since the original intervals are sorted by start time increasingly, so we only care the location for right start time.
#### Assumption: N = the number of intervals
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)

      start_r, end_r = secondList[R]
      start_cur, end_cur = max(start_l, start_r), min(end_l, end_r)
      if start_cur <= end_cur:
