#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N) use the string to convert between date object and string

          break
    left += 1
  return "".join(s)
```
#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N) use a list to store the string, help on letter swap, otherwise string concatenation is extra O(N), which would bring up runtime complexity to O(N^2), we use more space to reduce time.

#### Assumption: N = the length of the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1) in place updating, exclude the given list space as extra
