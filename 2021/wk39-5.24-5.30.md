```python
from math import ceil
def main(arr):
   size = ceil(len(arr) * 0.25)
   cnt = -1
   pre = arr[0]
   for i in arr:
      if i == pre:
            cnt += 1
      else:
            if cnt > size:
               break
            else:
               cnt = 1
      pre = i
   return pre      
```
#### Note: one pass iteration, stop early strategy.
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the arr
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)
```python
from collections import Counter
def main(arr):
   return Counter(arr).most_common()[0][0]          
```
#### Note: shortest code, however, it is slower than the previous method, also worse runtime+space. 
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the arr
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)

```python
def main(num):
   cnt = 0
   while num > 0:
      if num % 2 == 0:
            num /= 2
      else:
            num -= 1
      cnt += 1
   return cnt
```
#### Assumption: N = the given number size
#### Complexity: runtime = O(logN), space = O(1)

# [1816](https://leetcode.com/problems/truncate-sentence/)
```python
def main(s, k):
   return " ".join(s.split(" ")[:k])
```
#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string, K = truncate length
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)
```python
def main(s, k):
   cur = 0
   idx = 0
   while cur < k and idx < len(s):
         if s[idx] == " ":
            cur += 1
         idx += 1
   return s[:idx].rstrip()
```
#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string, K = truncate length

      while True:
            idx = curText.find(i)
            if idx > -1:
               curText = curText.replace(i, "-" + i[1:], 1)
               res += [[idx, idx+len(i)-1]]
            else:
               break

#### Assumption: T = the length of the given text string, W = the number of the given list of words
#### Complexity: runtime = O(T), space = O(1)
