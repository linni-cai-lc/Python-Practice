#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N) utilize dictionary to keep records for counts

```python
def main(num):
   return num in (6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336)

#### Utilize problem sugar
#### Assumption: N = the given number size
#### Complexity: runtime = O(1), space = O(1)

```python
def main(s, shift):
   cur = 0
   for direction, amount in shift:
      if direction == 0:
         cur += amount
      else:
         cur -= amount
   cur %= len(s)
   return s[cur:] + s[:cur]
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given shift, S = the length of the given string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(S+N), space = O(1)

   for i in range(len(nums) // 2):
      res += [nums[2*i+1]] * nums[2*i]
   return res
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1) excluding the result

   return arr
```
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)
```python
def main(arr):
   change = True
   while change:
      change = False
      pre = arr[0]
      for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):

            change = True
         elif arr[i] > arr[i+1] and arr[i] > pre:
            arr[i] -= 1
            change = True
         pre = tmp_pre
   return arr
```
#### Note: Remember the previous to reduce space complexity from linear to constant
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)

                  return False
      else:
            return False
   return True
```
#### Utilize hash map(dict) to help quick lookup piece start element in the arr
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the given arr
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)
