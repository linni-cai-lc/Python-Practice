```python
from collections import defaultdict as dd
def main(moves):
    book_a = dd(int)
    book_b = dd(int)
    cnt = 0
    for i, j in moves:
        cur = book_a if cnt % 2 == 0 else book_b
        cur["r"+str(i)] += 1
        cur["c"+str(j)] += 1
        if i == j:
            cur["d1"] += 1
        if i == 2 - j:
            cur["d2"] += 1
        if 3 in cur.values():
            return "A" if cnt % 2 == 0 else "B"
        cnt += 1
    return "Pending" if cnt < 9 else "Draw"
```
#### Utilize dictionary to store the number on each vertical/horizontal/slope line
#### Assumption: N = the number of moves
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)

# [276](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/)
```python
def main(n, k):
   if n == 0:
      return 0
   c1, c2 = 0, k
   for i in range(2, n+1):
      c1, c2 = c2, (c1 + c2) * (k - 1)
   return c1 + c2
```
#### Note: this is a dp problem.
- Let's assume:
  - F[i][0] = the number of ways to paint the first i fences, i and i-1 have different colors
  - F[i][1] = the number of ways to paint the first i fences, i and i-1 have the same color
- F[i][0]:
  - i = 1: k
  - i > 1: (F[i-1][0] + F[i-1][1])*(k-1) = #(pre and cur have different colors) + #(pre and cur have the same color) * #(colors left)
- F[i][1]:
  - i = 1: k
  - i > 1: F[i-1][0]
#### Assumption: N = the number of fences, K = the number of colors
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)

# [746](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)
```python
def main(cost):
   c1, c2 = 0, 0
   for i in cost[::-1]:
      c1, c2 = i + min(c1, c2), c1
   return min(c1, c2)
```
#### Note: this is a dp problem. 
- Let's assume F(i) = the min cost of the i th element.
- The dp formula: F[i] = C[i] + min(F[i-1], F[i-2]), since it is easier to calculate from the back to the front. When we have cost reversed version, convert to following.
- The new formula: F[i] = C[i] + min(F[i+1], F[i+2]). c1 is to accumulate cost with current cost, c2 is to give up current cost (skip).
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the cost list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)

# [303](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)
```python
from collections import defaultdict as dd

class NumArray:


    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.book = dd(int)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.book[i+1] = self.book[i] + nums[i]
        

    def sumRange(self, i: int, j: int) -> int:
        return self.book[j+1]-self.book[i]
```
#### Utilize default dict to provide set search, to improve runtime to O(1)
#### Assumption: N = the number elements in the array
#### Complexity: runtime = O(1), space = O(N)

# [232](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)
```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.lst = []
        

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """
        Push element x to the back of queue.
        """
        self.lst += [x]
        

    def pop(self) -> int:
        """
        Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element.
        """
        return self.lst.pop(0)
        

    def peek(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the front element.
        """
        return self.lst[0]
        

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the queue is empty.
        """
        return len(self.lst) == 0
```

# [266](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation/)
```python
from collections import Counter
def main(s):
    book = Counter(s)
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in book:
        if book[i] % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
        else:
            odd += 1
    return odd == (len(s) % 2)
```
#### Utilize counter to help count the letter occurrence:
- for even length, there should be no letter occurred in odd times
- for odd length, there should be one letter occurred in odd times
#### Assumption: N = the given string length
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(N)

# [1046](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapify
def main(stones):
    stones = [-i for i in stones]
    heapify(stones)
    while len(stones) > 1:
        # print(stones)
        maxi_1 = heappop(stones)
        maxi_2 = heappop(stones)
        # print(maxi_1, maxi_2)
        if maxi_1 != maxi_2:
            heappush(stones, maxi_1-maxi_2)
    return -sum(stones)
```
#### Note: utilize max-heap to help reduce time complexity, since python heap supports min-heap, we convert the original stone list to negative, then the max would be the min, fit the heap.
#### Assumption: N = the number of elements in the stone list
#### Complexity: runtime = O(NlogN), space = O(1) modify original list in-place

### Template

```sql

# []()
```python

#### Assumption: N = ??
#### Complexity: runtime = O(?), space = O(?)
