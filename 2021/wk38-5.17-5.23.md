   i = 0
   exist = 0
   while exist > -1:

      if exist > -1:

#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N^2), space = O(1)

```python
def main(currentState):
   res = []
   for i in range(len(currentState)-1):
      if currentState[i:i+2] == '++':
            res += [currentState[:i] + '--' + currentState[i+2:]]
   return res
```
#### Note: improve complexity to O(N)
#### Assumption: N = the length of the given string
#### Complexity: runtime = O(N), space = O(1)
